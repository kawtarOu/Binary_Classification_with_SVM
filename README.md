# Binary_Classification_with_SVM
Classifying two classes on five differents datasets from differents fields , with differents kernel functions
In this work we have presented the Support Vector Machines which are very interesting models whose main strengths are as follows:
- Efficiency in large spaces
- Efficiency in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
- The use of a subset of learning points in the decision function (called support vectors), which also makes it memory efficient.
- Versatility/flexibility: different core functions can be specified for the decision function.
However, care must be taken in the special case where the number of "features" is much larger than the number of samples, 
because a bad choice of kernel functions can lead to over-fitting.
